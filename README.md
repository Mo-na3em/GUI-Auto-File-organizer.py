# GUI-Auto-File-organizer.py
The File Organizer is a Python-based app that automatically sorts and organizes files into folders. Its intuitive GUI, built with tkinter, lets users initiate the process with a click. The tool scans the selected directory, moving or copying files to folders based on extensions. Unrecognized files go to an "Other" folder.
